# ActiveLearningApp
A Web App That Performs Active Learning

To use this web app, place your images inside the www/images directory (there are 12 pre-loaded images).  If you have data that is 
featurized already, place that data in the directory of your project (there is a sample demo featurized dataset corresponding to the pre-
loaded images).  Make sure your featurized dataset contains a column that has the names of all of your image files, and another, single 
column, with labels for your data.  It is preferred, but not required, that your labels column is called 'label' and your column with the
image filenames is called 'image'.
